IMPLEMENTATION OF ROUND ROBINSCHEDULING
ALGORITHM
AIM:
To write a C program to implement Round Robin scheduling algorithm.
DESCRIPTION:
For round robin scheduling algorithm, read the number of processes/jobs in the system, their CPU burst times, and the size of the time slice. Time slices are assigned to each process in equal portions and in circular order, handling all processes execution. This allows every process to get an equal chance. Calculate the waiting time and turnaround time of each of the processes accordingly.
ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Get the input process and their burst time. Step 3: Sort the processes based on priority.
Step 4: Compute the waiting time and turnaround time for each process. Step 5: Calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time. Step 6: Print the details about all the processes.
Step 7: Stop the program.
